# Github Notes

Github Notes is a spin-off of [Github Color Scheme](https://github.com/mbixby/github-color-scheme) with a couple of modifications:

* no penalization of strings and instance variables (e.g. `@property` in Coffeescript) – being neutrally colored, they don't drive attention and generate any color patterns in a document
* lower importance of comments to encourage self-explanatory code (ball pen blue replaced with warm grey)
* more natural black pen color for unstyled foreground text

## Remarks     

* Use with [Bluebird](https://github.com/mbixby/bluebird) for Sublime. Bluebird also includes packages for Markdown and Coffeescript with better support for Github color scheme. 
  
* In modern typography, various features are used to improve readibility of your documents. In addition to different colors, you are provided with different sizes of fonts, weights, italics, kerned-type, leading or paragraph-specific leading. In lack of software with such features, try Sublime with Monaco Lives font at 13 - 14 px (part of Bluebird).   

* Code that smells nice is a code that looks nice.   

* Try also [Blackbird](https://github.com/mbixby/blackbird) & [Facebook](https://github.com/mbixby/facebook-color-scheme) theme.
